                        <p>In my most recent appointment as a technical lead of the e-Channels system, I have tasked
                            with overseeing the modernisation of the legacy application, which I did with zeal and zest.
                            My stint in that position saw me completing the modernisation of many legacy applications
                            with more advance platforms. I being a technical leader involved in the development of
                            in-house applications as well as designing, consultation and implementation of
                            vendor-developed applications.
                            My work was mostly evolved in modernisation and integration. I have rich experience in
                            modernisation of Mainframes by integrating it with more advanced architectures, using
                            technologies such as ESB, CDC, ODS, ODM, MQ, z/OS connect, API Connect, Crossplex and TCPIP.
                            Also, I have worked on the migration of legacy systems into modern and cloud-based
                            technologies.</p>

                        <p>Immensely contributed to redesigning the mobile banking application to modern technologies
                            and successfully integrated all the back end services using ESB and MQ layer. Also,
                            optimised the system by implementing oracle based database system ODS for inquiry functions.
                            Also, I have redesigned the bill payment system to optimise its performance. This project is
                            one of the milestone projects in the digitisation initiative. Apart from the customer
                            values, it has brought an optimised and cost-effective option to the existing architecture.
                            The mobile app has received “The Best Mobile Banking APP” award from International Finance
                            Magazine in 2017 and it was one of the highest-ranking App in 2019.</p>

                        <p> Have rich experience in this area where I followed different approaches such as Re-Platform
                            where existing application components of legacy system migrated to new platforms such as ODS
                            and ESB. The other approach followed was Re-architecture, where the existing architecture of
                            our B2B system is migrated to more advanced tools such as DataPower. As one of the
                            replacements to the legacy system, I am working on cloud computing, where we are migrating
                            certain services to the private cloud. I am working on interface layer for seamless
                            integration and migration. </p>

                        <div>Let’s start with the basics of API. In this video, an attempt has been made to explain the
                            API in layman terms so that any person can understand and relate it with its realtime
                            application. An Application Programming Interface (API) is nothing but a common set of
                            routines, protocols or programs used for data transmission between one software product to
                            others. It has many functions usually it is used to speed up software development by
                            integrating it between different systems. To understand it let us take a familiar example
                            where a man is constructing his house and there are many components such as windows, doors,
                            or nowadays we get precast materials for partitions and flooring which contractor doesn’t
                            need to cast on site. He can simply get it from the manufacturer and install it on the
                            building to speed up the construction work. The API serves the same purpose where one
                            developer can use already used and tested set of programs of another developer. The APIs are
                            very critical not only in programming points but also in business terms, which has explained
                            in this video with an airline booking example. It also opened the door for small developers
                            and also there are opportunities for small businesses to develop their websites by
                            integrating with different B2B services.</div>

                        <h3 class="mb-0">Introduction:</h3>
                        <div>The API gateway is an HTTP server that sits in front of APIs serving different' functions
                            such as administration, routing, security, load balancer and many more.
                            Traditional Flow: Let’s look at the traditional flow first. In this flow when a user first
                            access the home page the client fires the home page URL to microservice which in turns fetch
                            the DATA from BE and sends the response back to the client to populate the web page. There
                            will be different microservices serving the different functions such as Login, browse and
                            payments. This is a monolithic application architecture where the application is fetching
                            data from each microservice directly.
                            <h3 class="mb-0">Pain Points:</h3>
                            Let’s see what the pain points in this flow are and how we can mitigate it with the help of
                            API Gateway.
                            <div></div>1. The first downside of this architecture is the FE has to call each of
                            microservices directly and it will have several individual public endpoints that are
                            connecting to applications. So it means whenever there is any change in web service the
                            client needs to make the changes and vice versa. So this makes maintenance difficult also
                            there may be more downtime during the activity as there could be impact even for a small
                            change. This brings us our first concern on the Adaptability.
                            <div></div>2. Also since the application endpoints are directly exposed to the external
                            network, the risk of unauthorized access to the application will increase. This brings us
                            another concern of Authorization and Security.
                            <div></div>3. Since the endpoints are public the communication needs to be more secure and
                            this can be done by changing the HTTP calls to more secure HTTPs calls and for HTTPs call
                            the SSL certificate need to be deployed at both the ends. So this component needs to be
                            added in application-level causing more overhead. Also, there may be additional task
                            microservice may be doing which are not related to application logic for example session
                            management to intercept any unauthorized access during the transaction flow or to have a
                            single sign-on so that at a given time only one authorized login can be allowed. Here we can
                            make out the scope for optimization in this flow.
                            The solution to the Traditional Approach: As we have seen here this is a single monolithic
                            Direct Client to Microservice Communication where microservice is responsible for serving
                            the client as well as performing all the functions needed to complete a task. Instead of
                            microservices performing all these tasks, it is much better to use controlled centralized
                            access to the system.
                            Now let’s see how the API gateway addresses all these pain points.
                            <h3 class="mb-0">mitigate pain points:</h3>
                            <div>1. Since we have a single entry point for external requests and also the FE is not
                                calling application directly hence some changes in application request can now be taken
                                care of by API gateway. For example, there is a change for routing request from one
                                microservice to another microservice can be done at API Gateway level without any
                                changes at FE client. Let’s say at a later point of time we decided to display promotion
                                and offers on Home page itself so that consumer doesn’t need to click on the promotion
                                link to get the details. So when the user requests the home page the API gateway will
                                receive only one request from the client. There is a component in API gateway which
                                makes calls to different microservices on behalf of the client. And then once API
                                gateway receives a response from both the microservice it formats it into one response
                                message and sends back to FE. So from the client perspective, there will be only one
                                request and one response. Thus a business can easily adapt certain changes without
                                changing actual application code also due to the fewer calls it gives a better response
                                time to the client. This mitigates our first pain point.
                            </div>
                            <div>2. Okay now as we have seen in a traditional monolithic flow SSL certificate and
                                signature validation components which were installed at service level can now be
                                separate out and moved to API Gateway giving additional security so that any
                                unauthorized or invalid request will be intercepted at the entry point itself before
                                they access the system. Also, since all these public endpoints are now internal the
                                Authorization is now done at the entry-level in API gateway this will also solve our

                                can now be separated out and moved to API Gateway Reducing the load on BE applications.
                                Let’s say there are certain web services that serve only static HTML page which has no
                                variable data those changes over time. So in our case home page can now be served by API
                                Gateway instead of microservice, eliminating this microservice completely. So this
                                mitigates our pain point 3</div>

                            This video is about API for mainframes using z/OS Connect. This is the concluding session on
                            a series of API. You may check out my earlier videos on "Overview of API" and then "API
                            Gateway" on the links.

                            With the advancement in mobile and cloud computing, RESTful API and JSON are popular choices
                            for application developers. On the other hand, the Back end mainframe is a legacy system
                            which is known for being a reliable system for critical data processing and storing. The
                            front end mobile application or cloud computing needs to access the z/OS system in a best
                            optimised way. IBM has developed z/OS connect to provide the solution. </div>
